## 正文
Titanium and its alloys are ideal materials for aerospace industry because of the high strength[1] to resist high temperature. Moreover they are ideal materials for marine, petroleum, chemical, pharmaceutical and other industries due to good corrosion resistance [2-5]. 

With the rapid development of modern oil industry, oil and gas drilling puts forward higher requirements for the drilling technology, especially some particular processes of well drilling. Some conventional drilling tools are unable to meet drilling requirements. A series of drilling tools are developed for meeting requirements of special and complex wells[6]. Titanium alloy drill pipe is a new variety of recently developed products. It has less structural stress, good flexibility, fatigue resistance, corrosion resistance and light mass comparing to conventional steel drill pipe. Furthermore it has good adaptability in the high curvature borehole drilling applications[7-10]. 

Ti6Al4V alloy has high tensile strength and resistance fatigue strength, low modulus of elasticity, low density, high hardness and good corrosion resistance. It’s often used as the drill pipe. The Grant Prideco subsidiary of Weatherford and RTI International company in the Texas subsidiary RTI Energy Systems has developed a titanium alloy drill pipe, which not only has the strength of steel drill pipe, but also is a flexible and light, synthetic material with corrosion resistance and durability[11-14]. However, the toughness of Ti6Al4V alloy is poor, which restricts its wide application and promotion in oil field. 

Material’s properties are determined by the microstructure. Titanium alloy’s microstructure can’t be altered or controlled by varieties of thermo-mechanical treatments[15,16]. Heat treatment can improve its microstructure and mechanical properties. Some studies show rapid heat treatment can provide a significant improvement of intragrain structure and mechanical properties of cast (α+β)-titanium alloys. Once a paper reported the Ti6Al4V alloy with a coarse grain α-phase
preform condition required longer heat treatment time to refine the structure and provided a modest improvement in mechanical properties [17,18]. Some studies about curves of grain size of primary α-phase are oscillatory in the α+β two-phase region with the rise of deformation temperature. Meanwhile the volume fraction of primary α-phase decreases. Heat treatment has a very important role in affecting microstructure and improving comprehensive properties of titanium alloy[19-21]. The purpose the present paper is to explore parameters for improving microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V alloy through different solution and aging treatments.

钛及其合金是航空航天工业的理想材料，因为它具有极佳的高温强度[1]。此外，由于其良好的耐腐蚀性，它也是海洋、石油、化工、制药和其他行业的理想材料[2-5]。

随着现代石油工业的快速发展，石油和天然气钻探对钻探技术提出了更高的要求，尤其是一些特殊的钻井过程。但许多传统的钻井工具无法满足钻井要求，为了满足特殊、复杂的钻井需求，一系列的钻井工具应运而生[6]。其中，钛合金钻杆是新近开发的一个新产品。与传统的钢质钻杆相比，它的结构应力小、韧性好、抗疲劳，耐腐蚀、质量轻。此外，它在高曲率钻孔作业中也具有良好的适应性[7-10]。

由于Ti6Al4V合金具有高抗拉强度和抗疲劳强度、低弹性模量、低密度、高硬度和良好的耐腐蚀性，它经常被用作钻杆。Weatherford 公司的Grant Prideco子公司和RTI国际大托拉斯在德州的子公司<u>RTI能源系统</u>已经开发出了钛合金钻杆，它不仅具有钢质钻杆的强度，而且是一种柔性轻质的合成材料，具有抗腐蚀和耐久性[11-14]。但是，Ti6Al4V合金的韧性较差，这限制了它在油田的广泛应用和推广。

组织决定性能。由于钛合金的微观结构不能被各种热机械处理所改变或控制[15,16]，只有通过热处理来改善其微观结构和机械性能。一些研究表明，快速热处理可以使铸态(α+β)钛合金的晶体结构和机械性能得到明显改善。另一篇论文表明：具有粗大的初生晶粒α相的Ti6Al4V合金在预制条件下，需要更长的热处理时间才能细化结构，并适度地改善机械性能[17,18]。在一些关于原生α相的晶粒尺寸的研究中发现，α+β两相区会随着变形温度的升高而变化，同时，初生α相的体积分数会逐渐下降。热处理在影响钛合金的微观结构和改善综合性能方面具有非常重要的作用[19-21]。本文的目的是通过探索不同的固溶和时效处理方法来改善Ti6Al4V合金的微观结构和力学性能，并找到最佳的热处理工艺制度。

### 试验

Six preliminary heat treatment systems were selected in the experiment. It is decided according to the temperature of phase transition. The heat treatment processes are shown in Table 1. The Ti6Al4V alloy was heat treated before the fracture toughness test for determine the influence of (α+β)-phase morphology on its fracture toughness. Heat treatment was conducted in the SX-4-13 box-type resistance furnace. When the heat treatment finished, the microstructure analysis, tensile mechanical test, instrument impact test, X-ray diffraction (XRD) test and environment scanning electron microscope (ESEM) observation of fracture morpho- logy were carried out.

试验材料是一种高强度的热轧Ti6Al4V钛合金，其厚度为6毫米。其化学成分（质量分数，%）为铁（Fe）<0.25，碳（C）<0.06，氢（H）<0.008，氮（N）<0.040，氧（O）<0.065，铝（Al）5.5~6.2，钒（V）3.5~4.0，其余为Ti。实验中选择了六个初步的热处理系统。它是根据相变的温度决定的。热处理过程如表1所示。为了确定(α+β)相形态对其断裂韧性的影响，Ti6Al4V合金在断裂韧性试验前进行了热处理。热处理是在SX-4-13型箱式电阻炉中进行的。热处理结束后，进行了微观结构分析、拉伸力学试验、仪器冲击试验、X射线衍射（XRD）试验和环境扫描电子显微镜（ESEM）对断裂形态的观察。热处理前后的Ti6Al4V合金管被加工成板条拉伸试样。在MTS810液压伺服万能试验机上进行了静态拉伸试验。拉伸试样包括的参数尺寸描述如下。厚度为7毫米。宽度是（20±0.05）毫米。测量长度为（60+0.5）毫米。夹持端长度为50毫米。平行段和夹持端之间的曲率长度大于或等于12。拉伸样品的总长度大于或等于184毫米。拉伸试验符合ISO 6892:1998的规定。测量了拉伸强度σb和屈服强度σ0.2以及伸长率δ。断裂韧性是根据金属夏比缺口冲击试验法的标准，通过仪器冲击试验进行测试的。试样的尺寸为10mm×5mm×55mm。设备为ZBC2302-D型冲击试验机。其冲击能量为294J，冲击速度为5.24m/s。热处理前后的试样的微观结构用奥林巴斯PMG-3型显微镜进行了分析。试样被打磨成圆形，并在270K的试剂中进行蚀刻，该试剂为1mL HF+30mL HNO3+30mL H2O2。用FEI Quanta 450 ESEM观察冲击断裂。断口观察对于分析断裂特征和机制是必不可少的。

### 结果与讨论
The α-phase is the substrate phase of (α+β)-titanium alloy. The number, shape and size of α-phase determine directly the property of (α+β)-titanium alloy. In the two-phase region, (α+β)-phase is gotten from the heat treatment with different holding time and temperatures. The temperature is below the phase transition temperature. The main characteristics of (α+β)-phase microstructure are irregular shape of grains, continuous and discontinuous α-phase on the grain boundary, and many small secondary α-phases. The punctate, spherical, flakiness and short rod α-phase exists in intragranular[22]. However, all (α+β)-phase will be converted into β-phase when the heating temperature is higher than phase transition temperature. The size and shape of grains are not identical. They are quadrilateral, pentagon and hexagon. Solution and aging can eliminate or reduce α-phase of continuous grain boundary. They can improve significantly the tensile and fatigue strength. But the plasticity will decrease a little. Solution and aging treatment can improve obviously the fatigue strength. The more stable β-phase of alloy, the more β-phase metastable after quenching. Then the effect of aging strengthening is better. Maximum effect will be gotten when the temperature of β stable element reaches CK value. Strengthening effect decreases with the rise of β-phase. That causes precipitation of aging β-phase metastable and the number of α-phase declines. Ti6Al4V alloy is (α+β)-phase alloy. The microstructure and mechanical properties can be improved by the solution and aging heat treatment, and then better comprehensive properties can be obtained [23,24].

α-相是(α+β)-钛合金的基体相。α相的数量、形状和大小直接决定了(α+β)-钛合金的性能。在两相区，(α+β)-相是通过不同的保温时间和温度的热处理得到的。该温度低于相变温度。(α+β)相的主要特征是晶粒形状不规则，晶界上有连续和不连续的α相，以及许多小的次级α相。颗粒内存在点状、球状、片状和短杆状的α-相[22]。然而，当加热温度高于相变温度时，所有的（α+β）相都会转化为β相。晶粒的大小和形状不尽相同。它们是四边形、五边形和六边形。溶解和老化可以消除或减少连续晶界的α相。它们可以显著提高拉伸和疲劳强度。但塑性会降低一些。溶解和时效处理可以明显改善疲劳强度。合金的β相越稳定，淬火后的β相就越容易转移。那么时效强化的效果会更好。当β稳定元素的温度达到CK值时，会得到最大的效果。強化效果會隨著β相的增加而降低。这导致了时效性β相的析出，以及α相的数量下降。Ti6Al4V合金是（α+β）相合金。通过固溶和时效热处理可以改善其微观结构和力学性能，进而获得更好的综合性能[23,24]。

#### 热处理对Ti6Al4V合金微观结构的影响
Microstructures of Ti6Al4V alloy after different heat treatments can be seen in Fig.1. According to the microstructure obtained, the heating temperature is under (α+β)→β transus temperature, and much equiaxed structure can be obtained. But the proportion of shifting organization is less. When the heating temperature is higher than the (α+β)→β transus temperature, the coarse grains and sheet microstructure can be obtained. It can be seen clearly that original β grain and obvious α-phase appear separately along the grain boundary. The original β grain transforms to the long and staggered microstructure, which braids in different places. Fig.1a is the microstructure of annealed alloy. It is a mixture of the primary α-phase and (α+β)-phase. From Fig.1b to Fig.1f, it can be seen that the microstructure consists of β-phase and (α+β)-phase when the alloy is treated by solution and aging. But the microstructure after aging is coarser. The quenching temperature of Fig.1b is 920 °C and α'-phase is fewer and smaller after quenching. The α'-phase converts into the mixture of fine and lamellar (α+β)-phase after aging treatment. The size of α'-phase becomes larger with the rise of aging temperature. The α'-phase with large size will convert to large (α+β)-phase with larger lamellar spacing after heat treatment. It can be seen from Fig.1c. That is a typical two-state microstructure. It can be gotten when the temperature is lower than the transus temperature. Comparing to α-phase of the solid solution, the size of α'-phase after aging gets coarser obviously. It can be speculated that α-phase which precipitates from α'-phase does not only forming lamellar, but also grows along the primary α-phase. So the size of α-phase gets coarser finally. The full solubility of strengthening phase and the uniform distribution of alloy elements on the grain boundary with the rise of solution temperature are presented in Fig.1d. With the rise of aging temperature, (α+β)-phase crystal grain increases gradually and gets bigger. At the same time, β-phase recrystallizes. Because β-phase increases, the diffusion of atom, the dissolution of phase，precipitation and gathering in the process of phase transition, leads β-phase to distribute in the islet near α crystal grain. When the temperature approaches to the β transus temperature, β-phase becomes the basal body. This microstructure has good plasticity and stability, but the creep property is poor. Martensite converts into α'-phase and metastable β-phase during the quenching course. It can be seen that the primary α-phase transforms completely into β-phase from Fig.1e. The lamellar β-phase and survival α-phase are arranged in the shape of group beam. The α-phase not only distributes uniformly along the grain boundary, but also arranges parallelly in the form of bundles which is embedded in β crystalline grain. Hence an obvious basket-like microstructure is obtained. The crystalline grain gets smaller, so comprehensive properties are improved. Because the cooling is water, β-phase in the high temperature section from the process of rapid cooling is too late to convert to α-phase. The martensite α〞and metastable state β-phase are gotten. The α〞and metastable state β-phase begin to decompose and produce dispersive (α+β)-phase basket-like microstructure with good fatigue property and other comprehensive properties. The dimension of schistose βphase gets smaller and stagger mutually.The microstructure is fined. That improves comprehensive properties of the alloy. From Fig.1e, the crystal grains become coarse and their size gets large with the solution temperature increasing. Moreover it is the shape of flaky microstructure and obvious α-phase appears. The α-phase with layered arrangement is embedded in the β-phase. Some residual α-phase distributes unevenly along the crystalline grain staggered microstructure like long strip. From Fig.1g, crystalline grains like lamellar are coarse. Original β crystalline grains convert into staggered microstructure like long strip.

图1中可以看到不同热处理后的Ti6Al4V合金的显微组织。根据得到的显微组织，加热温度在(α+β)→β跨度温度下，可以得到很多等轴结构。但移位组织的比例较少。当加热温度高于(α+β)→β transus温度时，可以得到粗晶和片状微结构。可以清楚地看到，原始的β晶粒和明显的α相沿晶界分别出现。原有的β晶粒转变为长而交错的微观结构，在不同的地方编织起来。图1a是退火合金的微观结构。它是原生α相和（α+β）相的混合物。从图1b到图1f可以看出，当合金经过溶液和时效处理时，其微观结构由β相和（α+β）相组成。但是时效后的微观结构更加粗大。图1b的淬火温度为920℃，淬火后α'-相更少更小。α'-相在时效处理后转化为精细和片状（α+β）-相的混合物。α'-相的尺寸随着老化温度的升高而变大。大尺寸的α'-相在热处理后将转化为大尺寸的(α+β)-相，具有较大的片状间距。从图1c可以看出。这是一个典型的两态微结构。当温度低于横截面温度时，可以得到它。与固溶体的α相相比，老化后的α'相的尺寸明显变粗了。可以推测，从α'-相析出的α-相不仅形成片状，而且还沿原α-相生长。因此，α-相的尺寸最终变得更粗。图1d显示了强化相的完全溶解度和合金元素在晶界上的均匀分布，随着溶液温度的上升。随着时效温度的上升，(α+β)相晶粒逐渐增加并变大。同时，β-相重新结晶。由于β相的增加，在相变过程中，原子的扩散、相的溶解、沉淀和聚集，导致β相分布在α晶粒附近的小区内。当温度接近于β晶体温度时，β相成为基体。这种微观结构具有良好的塑性和稳定性，但蠕变性能较差。马氏体在淬火过程中转化为α'-相和变质的β-相。从图1e可以看出，初级α相完全转化为β相。片状的β相和存活的α相呈组束状排列。α相不仅沿晶界均匀分布，而且以束状的形式平行排列，嵌入β晶粒中。因此，得到了一个明显的篮子状的微观结构。结晶晶粒变小，所以综合性能得到改善。由于是水冷却，快速冷却过程中高温段的β相来不及转化为α相。得到了马氏体α "和变质态的β-相。α "和变质态β相开始分解，产生分散的（α+β）相篮状微观结构，具有良好的疲劳性能和其他综合性能。分裂的β相的尺寸越来越小，相互交错，微观结构细化。这改善了合金的综合性能。从图1e可以看出，随着溶液温度的升高，晶粒变粗，尺寸变大。此外，它是片状微观结构的形状，并出现明显的α相。分层排列的α相被嵌入β相中。一些残留的α相沿着晶粒交错的微观结构不均匀地分布，像长条状。从图1g来看，像片状的晶粒是粗大的。原来的β晶粒转化为交错的微结构，如长条形。

#### 热处理对Ti6Al4V合金拉伸性能的影响
Table 2 shows the influence of solution and aging treatment on mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V alloy. The strength of Ti6Al4V alloy is improved greatly when the hot rolled state alloy experiences solution and aging treatment. The elongation is somewhat increased except for individual process. No.5 process can obtain the best comprehensive property with the parameters of 960 °C/1 h+WQ and 500 °C/4 h+AC. Comparing with that of the hot-rolled, yield strength (σ0.2) is increased by 50%, ultimate tensile strength (σb) by 42% and elongation δ increase by 11%. The strength and elongation increase with the rise of quenching temperature. But they increased firstly and then decrease. It could be presented the best solution temperature is 960 °C and the best aging temperature is 500 °C. When the Ti6Al4V alloy is heat treated by aging temperature 500 °C, the basket-like microstructure β-phase and (α+β)-phase mixture are obtained just like Fig.1e. They distribute near the crystalline boundary inside the α crystalline grain. That will make the alloy have good strength and elongation. It is noted that the strength of Ti6Al4V alloy increases when the solid-solution β-phase converts into martensite (α'-phase). Then martensite (α'-phase) converts into fine α-phase and β-phase. According to the description mentioned above, α-phase declines and β-phase increases in number. More α'-phase are converted from β-phase with the gradual rise of quenching temperature. Obviously, the more α'-phase, the better strength is gotten. The excessive coarse α-phase is preserved when solution temperature is too high. That results in the uneven material microstructure and thus the strength is possible to decrease due to stress concentration.

表2显示了固溶和时效处理对Ti6Al4V合金的机械性能的影响。当热轧状态的合金经历了固溶和时效处理后，Ti6Al4V合金的强度得到了很大的提高。除个别工艺外，伸长率有一定程度的提高。5号工艺在960℃/1h+WQ和500℃/4h+AC的参数下可以获得最佳的综合性能。与热轧相比，屈服强度（σ0.2）提高50%，极限拉伸强度（σb）提高42%，伸长率δ提高11%。强度和伸长率随着淬火温度的升高而增加。但它们先是增加，然后减少。可以看出，最佳固溶温度为960℃，最佳时效温度为500℃。当Ti6Al4V合金在500℃的时效温度下进行热处理时，就像图1e一样得到篮子状的微观结构β相和（α+β）相混合物。它们分布在α晶粒内的结晶边界附近。这将使合金具有良好的强度和伸长率。我们注意到，当固溶β相转化为马氏体（α'相）时，Ti6Al4V合金的强度会增加。然后马氏体（α'-相）转化为细小的α-相和β-相。根据上述描述，α相减少，β相数量增加。随着淬火温度的逐渐升高，更多的α'-相从β-相转化而来。显然，α'-相越多，得到的强度就越高。当溶液温度过高时，过多的粗大的α相被保留下来。这导致了材料微观结构的不均匀，因此，由于应力集中，强度可能会下降。

#### 热处理对冲击韧性的影响
Table 3 shows the impact toughness of samples. The resultis compared with the hot rolled sample’s impact toughness. It can be seen that the impact toughness value decreases with the rise of solution temperature. The impact toughness in aging temperature 450 °C is stabler than that at 500 °C. The best impact toughness is obtained when solution temperature is 960 °C, because when the quenching temperature is higher the α-phase microstructure is coarser. It will decrease the plasticity and toughness. The material toughness decreases with the rise of aging temperature when solution temperature is 920 °C. The toughness Ak is 40 J·cm-2 when the aging temperature is 450 °C; the toughness Ak is 38.21 J·cm-2 when aging temperature is 500 °C. With the rise of solution temperature, the curve of their correlation under certain aging temperature condition is shown in Fig.3. The toughness increases with the decrease of aging temperature when solution temperature is 1000 °C. The toughness Ak is 30.63 J·cm-2 when aging temperature is 500 °C; the toughness Ak is 33.05 J·cm-2 when aging temperature is 450 °C.

For analyzing the relationship between plastic fracture characteristics and microstructure of the material after heat treatment, the ESEM analysis of impact fracture from process 3 to 6 was carried out in order to determine the plasticity of the material under different conditions. The results are shown in Fig.2. Dimples are deep and big in Fig.2a. Its plasticity and toughness are good. It can be seen clearly the fracture forms along the crystalline grain. The less toughness fracture characteristic is seen from Fig.2b. The layer fracture along the direction of the lamellar structure phase can be seen in Fig.2c. The ability of thick slices of layered microstructure on the material resisting the fatigue cracking gets lower. The dimple is deep and big in Fig.2d and distributes evenly. It is obvious ductile fracture. The β metastable phase decomposes after solution and aging treatment. The α-phase precipitates preferentially and it distributes uniformly in crystalline grain boundary and β-phase. Finally (α+β)-phase is combined, which improves the strength and toughness obviously and enhances comprehensive properties. Dimples of Fig.2e are shallow that lead to the poor plastic and toughness.

With the solution temperature increases and the aging temperaturedecreasing, a large number of β metastable phase form with uneven distribution of α-phase in the crystalline grain boundary and territory. The fracture characteristic declines to quasi-cleavage fracture in the Fig.2f. It is noted that the fracture is prone to brittle fracture. Based on the two-phase titanium alloy, Ti6Al4V titanium alloy has the small, uniform spherical and basket-like mixture microstructure β-phase and (α+β)-phase. In the process of instrumented impact fracture experiment, the hole will form in the original phase and the boundary of the conversation microstructure. With the rise of impact deformation degree, these holes get bigger along the boundary of phase before the β-phase is across the cluster. The microstructure of mixture phase grows up comparing to the hole. The crack extension has the blocking effect. Therefore the mechanical property is affected by its shape, distribution, dimension and so on. It is concluded that two-state microstructure of two-phase is effective to block cavity growing and cracks extension.

表3显示了样品的冲击韧性。该结果与热轧样品的冲击韧性进行了比较。可以看出，冲击韧性值随着溶液温度的升高而降低。时效温度为450℃的冲击韧性比500℃的冲击韧性更稳定。当溶液温度为960℃时，获得最佳的冲击韧性，因为当淬火温度较高时，α-相的微观结构更粗。这将降低塑性和韧性。当溶液温度为920℃时，材料的韧性随着老化温度的上升而下降。当时效温度为450℃时，韧性Ak为40J-cm-2；当时效温度为500℃时，韧性Ak为38.21J-cm-2。随着溶液温度的升高，在一定的老化温度条件下，它们的相关曲线如图3所示。当溶液温度为1000℃时，韧度随老化温度的降低而增加。当老化温度为500℃时，韧性Ak为30.63J-cm-2；当老化温度为450℃时，韧性Ak为33.05J-cm-2。

为了分析热处理后材料的塑性断裂特征和微观结构之间的关系，对第3到第6道工序的冲击断裂进行了ESEM分析，以确定不同条件下材料的塑性。结果显示在图2中。图2a中的酒窝又深又大。它的塑性和韧性都很好。可以清楚地看到，断裂是沿着晶粒形成的。从图2b可以看出韧性较差的断裂特征。图2c中可以看到沿片状结构相的方向的层状断裂。厚片的层状微结构在材料上抵抗疲劳开裂的能力越来越低。图2d中的凹痕又深又大，分布均匀。这是明显的延性断裂。β变质相在溶液和老化处理后分解。α相优先析出，并均匀地分布在晶界和β相中。最后（α+β）相结合，明显改善了强度和韧性，提高了综合性能。图2e的酒窝较浅，导致塑性和韧性差。


随着溶液温度的升高和老化温度的降低，大量的β转移相形成，α相在晶界和领土上分布不均匀。在图2f中，断裂特征下降到准空隙断裂。值得注意的是，该断裂容易发生脆性断裂。在两相钛合金的基础上，Ti6Al4V钛合金具有小而均匀的球状和篮状混合微结构β相和（α+β）相。在仪器冲击断裂实验过程中，在原相和对话微观结构的边界会形成孔。随着冲击变形程度的增加，在β相跨群之前，这些孔沿着相的边界越来越大。混合相的微观结构与孔洞相比有所增长。裂纹的延伸具有阻挡作用。因此，机械性能受到其形状、分布、尺寸等方面的影响。结论是，两相的两态微观结构能有效地阻止空洞的增长和裂纹的扩展。

### 结论
1. The better microstructure of Ti6Al4V titanium alloy can be obtained in the process of 960 °C/1 h + WQ and 500 °C/4 h +AC, which is basket weave microstructure of lamellar β-phase and residual α-phase. It can produce good comprehensive properties.
2. Ti6Al4V alloy’s strength increases with the rise of solution temperature, and then it decreases. But ductility and impact toughness decreases gradually. However the strength decreases, but ductility and impact toughness increases firstly, and then decreases with the rise of aging temperature.
3. The fracture characteristic is transgranular ductile fracture. The α-phase distributes unevenly that reduces the plastic and the toughness.

1. 在960℃/1小时+WQ和500℃/4小时+AC的过程中，可以得到Ti6Al4V钛合金较好的微观结构，即片状β相和残余α相的篮状织构。它可以产生良好的综合性能。
2. Ti6Al4V合金的强度随着溶液温度的升高而增加，然后降低。但延展性和冲击韧性会逐渐下降。然而，强度下降，但延展性和冲击韧性首先增加，然后随着时效温度的升高而下降。
3. 3.断裂特征是跨晶粒延性断裂。α相分布不均匀，降低了塑性和韧性。
