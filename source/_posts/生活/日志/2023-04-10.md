## 日常
### 激昂
我要藉这一时的豪放和从容，

灵魂清醒的在喝一泉甘甜的鲜露，

来挥动思想的利剑，

舞它那一瞥最敏锐的锋芒，

象皑皑塞野的雪在月的寒光下闪映，

喷吐冷激的辉艳；

——斩，斩断这时间的缠绵，

和猥琐网布的纠纷，

剖取一个无瑕的透明，

看一次你，纯美，

你的裸露的庄严。…………

然后踩登任一座高峰，

攀牵着白云和锦样的霞光，

跨一条长虹，

瞰临着澎湃的海，

在一穹匀静的澄蓝里，

书写我的惊讶与欢欣，

献出我最热的一滴眼泪，

我的信仰，至诚，和爱的力量，

永远膜拜，

膜拜在你美的面前！

## 英文精读

THE PROBLEM with a catchy name is that sometimes it catches on too well. Take the hygiene hypothesis, outlined in 1989 by David Strachan of St George’s, a hospital and medical school in London. 

It suggests that **the rise of allergenic** sensitivity (observed in rich countries over the course of the 20th century) may have been caused by { (a corresponding decline in childhood infections), and also by (a shift from rural to urban living, so that children are no longer routinely exposed to farm animals.)}

该文章表明：在二十世纪以来的历程中，富裕国家中观察到了过敏敏感度提高的现象，这可能是由于这一时期中感染相关疾病的儿童数量下降所致，也可能是从农村到城市生活的转变使儿童不再每天接触农场动物所引起的。

Dr Strachan’s work still has much to recommend it. What the catchy label has fostered, however, is an erroneous belief that cleanliness is not necessarily a health benefit. In reality, says Thomas Marrs, a paediatric allergist at Kings College, London, hygiene is usually about bugs causing infection—and the bugs (that may be beneficial) are different from those which do that(这种好虫子跟其他那些（引起疾病的）不同). But it is plain to see why alternative descriptions, such as “the high turnover and diversity hypothesis” or “the microbial deprivation hypothesis”, have not caught on（变得流行）, more accurate though they may be.

In an attempt to collect further data on the matter, Okabe Hisao of Fukushima Medical University and his colleagues have trawled through the Japan Environment and Children’s Study, which tracked over 100,000 pregnancies between 2011 and 2014. Pursuing（寻找） the animal connection, they looked for correlations between household pet ownership before and immediately after a child’s birth, and any (food allergies) diagnosed (in that child’s first three years)(诊断这些儿童在三岁之前发生的任何食物过敏). They have just published their results in PLOS ONE.

Of the 66,000 or so children they chose to look at, 22% had been born into households with pets, and were thus exposed to microbesand other potential allergens from those animals both before and after birth.

他们观察了超过六万六千多个这样的儿童，其中百分之二十二的孩子出生在有宠物的家庭环境中，因此，**他们在出生前后**就暴露在来自这些动物的微生物和其他潜在致敏原之中。（"both before and after birth"调整语序到中间，读起来才更流畅。）


Children in households with dogs, the researchers found, had lower rates than average of allergies to eggs, milk and nuts. Those cohabiting with cats seemed more tolerant of eggs, wheat and soyabeans. However, children whose parents kept “turtles” (terrapins, in particular, are popular pets in Japan) appeared unaffected. And, curiously, those exposed to hamsters appeared more likely than average to be allergic to nuts.

| 动物 | 给孩童提供的抗过敏超能力 |
|:----:|:------------------------:|
|  狗  |     鸡蛋、牛奶、坚果     |
|  猫  |     鸡蛋、小麦、大豆     |
| 仓鼠 |     ⚠会对坚果更过敏      |


What exactly all this means is unclear（具体原因还是玄学）. One potentially important observation is that both pre- and postpartum exposure were needed for the observed effects to show up. Neither, by itself, was sufficient. Possibly, it is the time around birth itself which is the crucial factor（出生前的暴漏可能是一个关键因素）, for this is when it is believed that the bulk of a child’s gut flora（孩子的肠道菌群） is established.

There are confounding variables. The researchers themselves point out that pet-owning households are more likely to live in the countryside, with its other sources of immune-system-stimulating factors. 

共同作用的因素有很多。研究者自个儿就指出，养宠物的家庭多地处乡村，而乡村有许多刺激免疫系统的因素。


And, as Dr Marrs observes, allergy-prone families are less likely to own pets in the first place. These facts, rather than the presence of companion animals, might explain at least part of the effect.（易过敏的家庭首先不太可能拥有宠物。而这些事实相较于动物的存在，可能至少可以解释部分的影响。）
> 陷入因果循环了：过敏，所以不大可能养宠物，养宠物，所以孩子不容易过敏。如果前者这个心理学因素占的比重大的话，这个研究似乎没有太多意义了——实验样本本身就选错了。

Confirming or denying this will need more study. Nevertheless, Dr Okabe’s contribution is an interesting addition to the debate about Dr Strachan’s brainchild.
